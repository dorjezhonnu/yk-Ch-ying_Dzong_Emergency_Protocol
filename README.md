# Chöying Dzong Emergency Protocol

**Life on the mountain is danerous, emergency services are few and far between. In the event of a wildfire, or other life-threatening event, please be prepared with essential resources ready to go.**

## How to Prepare

Your "Go Bag" AKA "Bugout Bag" should contain all the essentials for 1-3 days of travel and survival:
- [ ] ID, phone, cash & credit cards, emergency contacts info, and any medications
- [ ] Change of clothes including coat, gloves, hat and blanket/sleeping bag
- [ ] Some nutrition bars and a water bottle
- [ ] First aid kit, flashlight, possibly a radio or tools

## Evacuatio Plan

If you hear sirens from the Baca Fire Department (not a test), or air horns form Chöying Dzong:

1. Leave a note in you cabin by the front door that you have left to meet at the Lhakhang (temple) with others.
2. Shut off propane tanks before leaving cabin
3. Grab your "Go Bag"
4. Head to the Lhakhang (temple) to meet with others
5. Check other cabins you pass on your decent to the Lhakhang (temple) 
6. We will all meet at Lhakhang (temple), and when all accounted for, evacuate on Camino Baca Grande road to County Road T. 
7. The Town of Crestone's rendezvous and public shelter is at Moffat School, at County Road T and Highway 17.
8. Please check in at Moffat School ASAP to the relevant public servants, so they don't have to search for you later.
9. Inform any relatives, emergency contacts or conserned parties of your status

* *Air Horns may be used to ward of predators. Or, if assistance is needed/evacuation required, blow the horn appropriately until assistance arrives* *
